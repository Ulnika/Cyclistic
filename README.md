### This is the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Specialization I completed in 2022.
### I conducted a comprehensive data analysis of a bike-share program to understand user behavior and provide recommendations for increasing subscriptions. 

# Scenario
Cyclistic is a bike-share program of 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic offers pricing plans:

single-ride passes for casual riders,
full-day passes for casual riders,
annual memberships for Cyclistic members. 
Annual members are much more profitable than casual riders

The director of marketing Lily Moreno believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships - convert casual riders into members. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

Cyclistic marketing analytics team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

# Ask
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
### Business task

What can stimulate the conversion of "casual riders" into "members" based on the differences in these kinds of users?

# Stakeholders

Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, the rest of the marketing analytics team, and the Cyclistic executive team.

# Prepare
The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.

For this analysis data for 2022 was taken.

# Conclusion and Act
Annual members use Cyclistic classic bikes for shorter rides more often on workdays.

Casual riders use Cyclistic electric bikes mostly on weekends for longer rides. The difference between the number of rides during summer and winter months is bigger for casual riders.

It may indicate that casual riders use bikes for entertainment purposes, especially during the summer months.

The casual riders would buy Cyclistic annual memberships if the company offers special conditions for weekends or summer time.

Cyclistic can use digital media to influence casual riders to become members by creating gamification for members.
