Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n\nUntil now, Cyclistic offers pricing plans: \n- single-ride passes for casual riders, \n- full-day passes for casual riders, \n- annual memberships for Cyclistic members. \n\nAnnual members are much more profitable than casual riders\n\nThe director of marketing Lily Moreno believes the company’s future success depends on *maximizing the number of annual memberships - convert casual riders into members*. \nMoreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.\n\nCyclistic marketing analytics team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\n\n### **Ask**\n1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\nBusiness task\n\nWhat can stimulate the conversion of \"casual riders\" into \"members\" based on the differences in these kinds of users? \n\nStakeholders\n\nLily Moreno, the director of marketing, the rest of the marketing analytics team, and the Cyclistic executive team.\n\n### **Prepare**\n\nThe data has been
